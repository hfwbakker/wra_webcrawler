PROJECT:
- Create a webcrawler that gets specific information on a series of website from wolframalpha.com, and output them to an excel sheet.
- Possible challenges: website outputs info in .img, presumably to hinder webcrawlers.

NEXT UP:
- Get more details about project parameters.
- Figure out tech deck.
- Figure out of Python requests can handle working with search requests inside a website that no doubt has it's tools to hinder webcrawlers.
